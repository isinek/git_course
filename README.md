# GIT Course

This is a simple and practical way to learn GIT basics and how to use git commands in the terminal.
Just run the script and follow the instructions.<br>
You'll need two terminals open in parallel, I recommend having them side-by-side.

At any moment you can use hints to help you with solving the task or reset the repo
state if you did something unexpected.<br>
If you maybe think that some task is too easy for you, you can use s and I'll solve
it for you.

Enjoy!
